        "* When accessing a single resource, we receive an *object* that consists of attributes and their values. When accessing a collection, we receive a *list* of objects.\n",

        "* When accessing a collection of resources, it's possible that the collection is to big to send to the client in one go. In this case we divide the collection in smaller pieces, often called *pages*.\n",
        "* When accessing a collection, we often want to *filter* the objects that returned to us. Eg. we do not want the collection of all Erfgoedobject, but a smaller part such as the collection of *all Erfgoedobjecten in Antwerpen*.\n",

        "\n",
        "So far, we've been filtering the collection. We tell the server we only want to see resources that match a certain criterium. We only want the ones that are in `Antwerpen` and are `built heritage`. Quite often this is what we want, but sometimes our needs are not as clear cut. We might have heard about a building called 'zwart huis` (black house) and wonder where it is. In this case, we can do a full-text query. With a full-text query we'll go looking through all the records for ones that match a certain word or set of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can do this by passing the `tekst` parameter when we execute our query. `tekst=zwart huis` will give us resources that contain the words `zwart huis`. This is not a simple a just matching the resources that are called `zwart huis`. The `tekst` parameter looks at the name, alternate names, the short description, the long description, thesauri, ... It does however recognise that resources having `zwart huis` in the title are probably more relevant than those having `zwart huis` somewhere in the long description. When we're using the `tekst` parameter, the sort order is automatically set to `relevantie`. This means that when we search for `zwart huis` we get all results that have something to do with `zwart huis`, but the one that is **the most relevant** `zwart huis` will be at the top. In this case, the first record is `Cinema 't Zwart Huis`, while the last result just contains the word `zwart` and the word `huis`. The sort order might not always be fully clear from the beginning. For example, the sixth result is something called [Dokterswoning Dr. De Beir](https://id.erfgoed.net/erfgoedobjecten/58649). It's listed fairly high because it has an alternate name `zwart huis` by which it's most commonly known to locals. \n",
        "\n",
        "Full-text searching in itself is quite and advanced topic. More information can be found in this [blog post](https://onroerenderfgoed.github.io/posts/2019/inventaris-zoeken-full-text/). It's also relevant to mention that we can combine full-text searches with filtering on other fields. If we only want to look for `zwart huis` in combination with built heritage, we would add `discipline=2` to our query.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, supposing we want to run our search for a `zwart huis` through the API, but we want to exclude results that contain the words `zwart` and `huis` but not in proximity, we would search for `\"zwart huis\"`."

It would hardly ever be what you're looking for and it would put a tremendous strain on our infrastructure, making us more vulnerable to attacks. It is possible to use the OR operator within a single parameter. You can filter on records who are built heritage OR landscape heritage, but not anything else.

Do bear in mind that some combinations don't make a lot of sense. Filtering on gemeente 1 AND gemeente 2 will generally not lead to a lot of results, since not a lot of erfgoed is situated in more than one gemeente. Similarly, looking for things that are both a `church` and a `urnfield` is probably not a very useful question. "
