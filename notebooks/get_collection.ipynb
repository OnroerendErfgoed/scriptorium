        "This notebook show how to access a collection of resources from the Agentschap Onroerend Erfgoed webservices. It assumes you have already mastered the techniques described in the [`get_resource` notebook](https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/scriptorium/blob/main/notebooks/get_resource.ipynb).\n",
        "\n",
        "Again we'll be using the Inventaris Onroerend Erfgoed as our example, but the techniques in this notebook could also be applied to the Onroerend Erfgoed Beelbank or Archeologieportaal.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea for accessing a collection is very similar to accesing a resource, we GET a certain URL. But, this time the resources does not reprensent a single resource, but a collection of resources. This has a few consequences:\n",
        "\n",
        "* When accessing a single resource, we receive an *object* that consists of attributes and their values. When accessing a collection, we receive a *list* of objects.\n",
        "* When accessing a single resource, we get all the data on a single object. When accessing a collection, we get a summary of each object in the collection. To get all the data, we need to GET the full resource.\n",
        "* When accessing a collection of resources, it's possible that the collection is to big to send to the client in one go. In this case we divide the collection in smaller pieces, often called *pages*.\n",
        "* When accessing a collection, we often want to *filter* the objects that returned to us. Eg. we do not want the collection of all Erfgoedobject, but a smaller part such as the collection of *all Erfgoedobjecten in Antwerpen*.\n",
        "\n",
        "# A simple example\n",
        "Let's start with a simple example. We'll request the entire collection of Erfgoedobject and output the first page of results we receive.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll also output how many results there actually are. This information is sent back by the server in the `Content-Range` header. This header will contain a value like `items 0-9/124`. This means we are viewing resources 0 through 9 (the first ten) out of a total of 124 resources.\n"
