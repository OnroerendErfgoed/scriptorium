        "Accessing a REST resource through Python is very easy when using the [Requests\n",
        "library](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/). It's a very flexible library that offers tremendous value for money. It's well worth spending some time with the documentation. These notebooks will show you the basics, but there is so much more out there.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea that we'll be using over and over consists of making a request and reading data from the response. In these scenarios we'll call our script the client where the requests originate. The response that we receive are sent by the server. \n",
        "\n",
        "Reponses can contain data in lots of different formats, but we'll mainly focus on JSON responses. These can be recognised by the `application/json` mime-type that is present in the `Content-Type` header of the response. This `Content-Type` is very important since it informs the client how it should try to interpret a certain resource. Flanders Heritage resources generally have at least two representations:\n",
        "* `application/json`: The resources serialised in a machine-readable format. Suited for scripts, wrangling data, other servers, ...\n",
        "* `text/html`: The resource serialised as HTML. Suited for your browser so you can read the resources when browsing the web.\n",
        "\n",
        "From time to time you might encounter other mime types when using Flanders Heritage webservices such as `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `application/rdf+xml`, `text/turtle`. Where applicable they will be explained."

We will focus on the first two, Erfgoedobjecten and Aanduidingsobjecten, and the relations between them. These relations indicate what the legal status is of a certain Erfgoedobject. To detect these, we look at the **relations** attribute of the Erfgoedobject. There are several types of relations, but we are only interested in the ones with Aanduidingsobjecten.

In this example we make one call for the Erfgoedobject and three calls for the Aanduidingsobjecten. We open and close the connection 4 times. Since all connections are to the same server (inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be), this is rather redundant. However, it's possible to use a single connection for all the GET requests by using a *requests.Session* object. This way, the connection will be opened once and closed once. The more requests we do in one script, the more performance we gain. It's also possible to set default values in a requests session, so we don't have to specify the same thing over and over again. Eg., we can set the *Accept header* as a default."

We've seen how to request other related resources and how to generate output in Markdown format. We now have a quick way of generating our own personal reports for an Erfgoedobject. The same principles we applied to Erfgoedobjecten, can be applied to other types of Flanders Heritage resource such as Aanduidingsobjecten or Waarnemingen or any other type not mentioned before.\n",

We're looking for information on all Erfgoedobjecten of type `church` or all Erfgoedobjecten in a certain province or municipality. Or a combination of those two. [The next notebook](https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/scriptorium/blob/main/notebooks/02_get_collection.ipynb) deals with accessing these collections of resources and filtering or searching them."
