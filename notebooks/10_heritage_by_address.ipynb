        "# What kind of heritage is here?\n",
        "\n",
        "For this script, we'll try to find out of what the heritage status of an address in Flanders is. Given a certain address, what do we know about the legal heritage status of it? Is it `beschermd` or not? Is it `vastgesteld` or not? We'll only take into account forms of legal protection. If it's been added to the inventory, but has not yet been `vastgesteld`, it won't appear here.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make this possible, we need to use 2 different webservices:\n",
        "* The [Digitaal Vlaanderen Location Service](https://loc.geopunt.be/Help/V4) that allows us to fetch information on an address in Flanders. It can tell us if the address exists (if not, possibly suggesting other addresses) and where the address is located geographically. This data and information is not being maintained by Onroerend Erfgoed.\n",
        "* The [Onroerend Erfgoed Geozoekdiensten Service](https://geo.onroerenderfgoed.be/zoekdiensten/api_doc) that allows us to do a spatial query for heritage in Flanders, using a geometry (eg. a point or polygon).\n",
        "\n",
        "For our purpose, we'll use the `location service` to turn an address into a point. Generally this will be the center of the administrative parcel the address is situated on or the building the address represents. Using this service is a two step process in itself. First, we ask is for suggestions given an address, then we take the first suggestion received to fetch the location of it. If there are multiple suggestions, we might want to change our input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we have the location data, we'll then use the `geozoekdiensten service` with this point to do a spatial intersection with all Onroerend Erfgoed GIS layers. We can configure this service slightly by telling it to only check for `aanduidingsobjecten` (designated heritage) and to add a buffer of X meters to the point we're querying with. We'll also tell the service to not return the geometry of any heritage objects we find sinc this makes the reply heavier and we don't currently need that information."

Applying the lessons from [our first notebook](https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/scriptorium/blob/main/notebooks/01_get_resource.ipynb), we simply do another GET request on the object's URI and we have all the information we could need."
