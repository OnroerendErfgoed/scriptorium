In those cases you might need to make more of an effort to get the results that you want, but because the data is all available, there's nothing you can't do with a little script. Bear in mind that this can put some strain on a server. If you're doing a lot of calls to a service it might be a good idea to reach out to the server administrator and ask them if they're ok with what you're doing or if they know of a better way to do what you want to do.\n",
