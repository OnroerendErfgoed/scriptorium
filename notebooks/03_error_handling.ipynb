        "As in life, things will go wrong sooner or later. Luckily REST services are built to handle errors gracefully. The main tool it uses for this is the HTTP Response Code. Every response we get from an HTTP server includes a status code. This status code tells us whether the request was succesfull or not and possibly why. All response codes are triple digit numbers. The first digit tells you in which broad category you are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* *200-299*: These response codes indicate success. By far the most common code in this category and probably the most common one of all is *200 OK*, signaling that all's well.\n",
        "* *300-399*: These response codes indicate redirection, telling the client the answer to their question can be found elsewhere.\n",
        "* *400-499*: These response codes indicate a client error, something the client might be able to fix be changing the request. Common errors in this category are:\n",
        " * *400 Bad Request*: Your request was unclear.\n",
        " * *404 Not Found*: The resource you're looking for does not exist.\n",
        " * *401 Unauthorized*: I can't send you the resource because I don't know who you are. Please authenticate first.\n",
        " * *403 Forbidden*: I can't send you the resource because I know who you are and you're not allowed to see the resource. Get more permissions.\n",
        "* *500-599*: These response codes indicate a server error. Something went wrong in the server and the client generally has not control over it. The most common error in this category is *500 Internal Server Error*.\n",
        "\n",
        "While there are a lot more error codes, you will do fine with the ones listed here. Remember, if it's starts with a 4, you should change. If it starts with a 5, the server is have issues and you can only wait a bit or contact the server administrator.\n",
