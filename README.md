This repository contains teaching materials about 
[Agentschap Onroerend Erfgoed](https://www.onroerenderfgoed.be) services and 
data. These consist of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
notebooks that can be run directly from the browser. Making it easy to get 
started with Python scripts without having to install Python on your local 
machine.

The notebooks are located in the `/notebooks` folder. They are numbered, more
or less in an ascending order of difficulty. If you're new to Python or REST
services, it's best to start with the basic examples and work your way up to
the more complex ones.

Every notebook has an `Open in Colab` badge that takes you directly to Colab.
To run the notebooks you will have to grant some permissions. Always check the
notebook you're working with before granting these.
